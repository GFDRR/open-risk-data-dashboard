            </br>
            <p>This page explains the methodology and rationale behind the Open Data for Resilience Index.</p>
            </br>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index is an online tool to track and assess the openness of key data related to disaster risk management (DRM) across the world.</p>

            <p>It follows the <a href="https://opendri.org/about/" target="_blank">principles</a> of the Open Data for Resilience Initiative stating that disaster risk data should be:
            <ul>
            <li>open by default,</li>
            <li>accessible,</li>
            <li>licensed and documented,</li>
            <li>co-created,</li>
            <li>locally owned, and,</li>
            <li>communicated in ways that meet the needs of diverse users.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Information available on the Open Data for Resilience Index is collected thanks to a crowdsourced-based effort. Contributors and users may be DRM specialists or any producer or user of disaster risk data. This includes organizations and individuals such as civil protection and emergency departments, geospatial and environment agencies, all other public entities, utilities, academia, media as well as open data and right to information advocates. </p>

            <p>The success of the Open Data for Resilience Index depends mainly on its contributors community and the way it engages with them. </p>

            <h2>Scope and use cases</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index can be useful in many different contexts. Below are some examples of use cases:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>A DRM specialist wants to conduct a disaster risk data inventory in a given country and assess the availability and ease of use for each dataset;</li>
            <li>A Government wants to improve its preparedness for natural disasters and identify what essential information is lacking or difficult to access;</li>
            <li>An insurance company wants to conduct a damage assessment and is seeking exposure data of certain assets;</li>
            <li>A transparency advocate is campaigning for better access to key data related to natural disasters in his/her country.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Furthermore, the Open Data for Resilience Index might help Governments and the DRM community to respond to the following questions:</p>
            <ul><li>Which data are essential to disaster risk management? How are they produced and shared?</li>
            <li>Which Governments should improve and invest more in open data for better disaster risk management?</li>
            <li>Which disaster risk data are the more/less open? For which type of hazard?</li>
            <li>Which principles of Open Data for Resilience are the most difficult to implement?</li>
            <li>Which Governments perform better regarding disaster risk data and why? Is there any correlation with the level of hazards?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Assumptions</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index has been developed with the following assumptions in mind:</p>

            <p>The role of a government is to curate or produce disaster risk datasets relevant to its territory or sub-territory. It should be accountable for the continued and effective use of the datasets through open publication of the data. The Open Data for Resilience Index therefore primarily focuses on assessing datasets per countries.</p>

            <p>There are countless datasets that may be used to perform DRM activities. However, only a few of them are critical, and if missing, may hinder or even prevent effective DRM. Those data are referred to as key risk datasets, and this project is about identifying, defining and assessing their openness across different places.</p>

            <p>Different datasets could match in part or completely with a specific key risk dataset description for a given territory. For instance you could have two different aerial imageries of your country provided by two different organizations. This is reflected in the Index where users can submit more than one dataset for a given key dataset description and a given country, each of them being assessed independently.</p>

            <h2>Datasets</h2>

            <p>The initial selection process of key disaster risk datasets was based on a consultation of DRM specialists, working on different types of hazards, and a review of disaster risk data projects, inventories and standards.</p>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index identified a set of 36 datasets considered to be key for DRM activities involving at least one of the following hazards: </p>

            <ul><li>Coastal flooding</li>
            <li>Cyclone</li>
            <li>Earthquake</li>
            <li>Landslide</li>
            <li>River flooding</li>
            <li>Tsunami</li>
            <li>Volcano</li>
            <li>Water scarcity </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Furthermore, the Open Data for Resilience Index distinguishes between five different categories of disaster risk data:</p>

            <ul>

            <li>Base data: key datasets necessary to conduct DRM activities, such as topographic and administrative maps of the territory.</li>

            <li>Exposure data: includes data on population and assets. Exposure describes the situation of people (e.g. how many), infrastructure and housing (e.g. where located), production capacities and other tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas.</li>

            <li>Hazard data: Data related to a type of hazard,  including any historical (observed) information or model related to the description and intensity of a hazard event. Hazards currently include coastal flooding, cyclone, earthquake, landslide, tsunami, volcano and water scarcity.</li>

            <li>Vulnerability data: this data describes the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or systems to be impacted by a hazard.</li>

            <li>Risk data: This data is derived from combining base data, exposure hazard and vulnerability data. It includes indicators from existing impact assessments (single event) or risk assessments (multiple events).</li>

            </ul>

            <p>For a better understanding of those categories and why there are key to disaster risk management see the diagram below.</p>

            <h2>Openness criteria</h2>
            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index uses a set of 10 questions to assess the openness of a given dataset. Those criteria are similar to other open data assessment frameworks, such as the <a href="http://index.okfn.org" target="_blank">Open Data Index</a> and the <a href="http://opendatabarometer.org/">Open Data Barometer </a>and in line with the OpenDRI principles.</p>

            <p>Below is the list of questions used to assess the openness of a dataset.</p>

            <ul><li>Does the data exist?</li>
            <li>Is the data available in digital form?</li>
            <li>Is the data publicly available?</li>
            <li>Is the data available online?</li>
            <li>Is the metadata available online?</li>
            <li>Is the data available in bulk?</li>
            <li>Is the data machine-readable?</li>
            <li>Is the data available for free?</li>
            <li>Is the data openly licensed?</li>
            <li>Is the data provided on a timely and up to date basis?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>Scoring methodology</h1>
            <p>A percentage of openness is provided for each dataset submitted. A dataset is considered fully open (100%) when all questions have been answered YES.</p>

            <p>Aggregated scores are also provided for type of hazards, risk data categories (Base data, Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability and Risk) and countries.</p>

            <p>For countries scoring, only the hazards for which the level is at least assessed as medium or higher on <u>ThinkHazard!</u> are taken into account. This means all data related to hazards with a low or very low level are not considered for assessing a country since the incentive to invest in such data is negligible. ThinkHazard! is a tool from GFDDR which highlights the likelihood of different natural hazards affecting project areas (very low, low, medium and high) based on published hazard data, provided by a range of private, academic and public organizations.</p>
            <h2>Data collection process</h2>

            <p><strong>Submission</strong></p>
            <p>Anyone registered on the website index.opendri.org can contribute to the Open Data for Resilience Index which follows a crowdsourced data collection process.</p>

            <p><strong>Validation</strong></p>
            <p>Each dataset submitted is then reviewed by at least one member of the team of reviewers made of OpenDRI staff and DRM specialists. The dataset submission is either marked as approved or rejected. The reviewer can also edit the data submission and correct or add additional information. Once submitted and while being reviewed, a dataset remains visible online to the public. </p>

            <p>If you want to become a reviewer, please send an email to [contact email to be defined]</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong></p>

            <h2>Similar projects</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index of GFDRR is inspired by the Open Data Index of Open Knowledge and the Open Data Barometer of the Web Foundation. It applies the idea of tracking and assessing open data to the DRM sector.</p>

            <p>The main differences with the Open Data Index and Open Data Barometer are:</p>

            <p>The number of submissions per dataset. In the Open Data for Resilience Index, it is possible to submit and approve more than one dataset for a given key dataset description and a given country. Each of those submissions are independently reviewed.</p>

            <p>The data collection phase. Whereas the Open Data Index and the Open Data Barometer are conducted on a yearly basis, the data collection phase for the Open Data for Resilience Index is conducted on a continuous and ongoing basis.</p>
