            <p>The <strong>Open Data for Resilience Index</strong> is a tool to identify, assess and compare, for any country, the availability and ease-of-use of 36 datasets that are considered to be key for disaster risk management.</p> 

            <p>Anyone can submit a dataset. The result is a crowdsourced-database providing the state of open data for disaster risk management. The website stores metadata only, not the data itself.</p>

            <h3>What is disaster risk management?</h3>
            <p><strong>Disaster risk management</strong> (DRM) includes all activities or actions for reducing vulnerability and building resilience to natural hazards.</p>

            <h3>What is open data?</h3>
            <p><strong>Open data</strong> is digital data that is made available with the technical and legal characteristics necessary for it to be freely used, reused, and redistributed by anyone, anytime, anywhere.</p>

            <h3>Why the Open Data for Resilience Index?</h3>
            <p>As access to information is becoming more and more critical to disaster risk management, there is a need to assess the state of open data in the sector, enable users to inventory and search for open data in an easier way, and enable Governments and data producers to see where they stand.</p>            

            <p>For more information about why an how open data is applied to disaster risk management, visit <a href="https://opendri.org" target="_blank">Open Data for Resilience Initiative</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="hazards">Hazards</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index currently covers the following hazards: </br><strong>River flooding</strong>, <strong>Earthquake</strong>, <strong>Volcano</strong>, <strong>Cyclone</strong>, <strong>Coastal flooding</strong>, <strong>Water scarcity</strong>, <strong>Landslide</strong>, <strong>Tsunami</strong>.</p>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>
            <h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
                    
            <p>The datasets are classified into five different categories that are relevant to disaster risk management: </br><strong>Base data</strong>, <strong>Hazard</strong>, <strong>Exposure</strong>, <strong>Vulnerability</strong>, <strong>Risk</strong>.</p>

            <p>Those categories haven been defined by taking into account the different components for assessing risk.</p>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index is an online tool to track and assess the openness of key data related to disaster risk management (DRM) across the world.</p>

            <p>It follows the <a href="https://opendri.org/about/" target="_blank">principles</a> of the Open Data for Resilience Initiative stating that disaster risk data should be:
            <ul>
            <li>open by default,</li>
            <li>accessible,</li>
            <li>licensed and documented,</li>
            <li>co-created,</li>
            <li>locally owned, and,</li>
            <li>communicated in ways that meet the needs of diverse users.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Information available on the Open Data for Resilience Index is collected thanks to a crowdsourced-based effort. Contributors and users may be DRM specialists or any producer or user of disaster risk data. This includes organizations and individuals such as civil protection and emergency departments, geospatial and environment agencies, all other public entities, utilities, academia, media as well as open data and right to information advocates. </p>

            <p>The success of the Open Data for Resilience Index depends mainly on its contributors community and the way it engages with them. </p>

            <h2 id="opendata">Open data criteria</h2>
            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index uses a set of 10 criteria formulated as questions, weighted in percentage, to assess to what extent a given dataset is open.</p>

            <ul><li>Does the data exist? +5% if yes</li>
            <li>Is the data available in digital form? +5%</li>
            <li>Is the data publicly available? +5%</li>
            <li>Is the data available online? +5%</li>
            <li>Is the metadata available online? +5%</li>
            <li>Is the data available in bulk? +10%</li>
            <li>Is the data machine-readable? + 15%</li>
            <li>Is the data available for free? + 5%</li>
            <li>Is the data openly licensed? + 15%</li>
            <li>Is the data provided in a timely and up to date basis? + 5%</li></ul>

            <p>A dataset is considered fully open when all questions have been answered YES (100%). When a dataset does not exist or has not been submitted, the score is 0.</p>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>
            
            <h2 id="scoring">Country score</h2>
            <p>The country score is the average of all datasets scores for a given country. It is expressed as a percentage.</p>

            <p>For the country score, only the hazards for which the level is assessed as medium or higher on <a href="http://www.thinkhazard.org" target="_blank">ThinkHazard!</a> are taken into account. This means that data related only to hazards with a low or very low level are not considered for assessing a country since the incentive to invest in such data is negligible. For instance, data related to tsunami will not be considered when scoring a landlocked country.</p> 

            <p>ThinkHazard! is a tool from GFDRR which highlights the likelihood of different natural hazards affecting project areas (very low, low, medium and high) based on published hazard data, provided by a range of private, academic and public organizations.</p>

            <p>It is possible to submit more than one dataset per dataset's description for a given country. However, for scoring purposes, only the dataset with the highest score is retained for country score.<p>

            <p>Lastly, it is possible to filter scores and compare countries by type of hazards and/or categories of data. For instance, by selecting earthquake, only datasets relevant to this hazard will be taken into account in the final score.<p>

            </div>

            <h2 id="submit">Datasets submission</h2>

            <p><strong>Submission</strong></p>
            <p>Anyone registered on the website can contribute to the Open Data for Resilience Index by submitting a dataset.</p>

            <p><strong>Validation</strong></p>
            <p>Each dataset submitted is then reviewed by at least one member of the team of reviewers made of OpenDRI staff and disaster risk management specialists. The dataset submission is either marked as approved or rejected. The reviewer can also edit the data submission and correct or add additional information. Once submitted and while being reviewed, a dataset remains visible online to the public.</p>

            <h2 id="usecases">Use cases</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index can be useful in many different contexts. Below are some Example of use cases:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>A DRM specialist wants to conduct a disaster risk data inventory in a given country and assess the availability and ease of use for each dataset;</li>
            <li>A Government wants to improve its preparedness for natural disasters and identify what essential information is lacking or difficult to access;</li>
            <li>An insurance company wants to conduct a damage assessment and is seeking exposure data of certain assets;</li>
            <li>A transparency advocate is campaigning for better access to key data related to natural disasters in his/her country.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Furthermore, the Open Data for Resilience Index might help Governments and the DRM community to respond to the following questions:</p>
            <ul><li>Which data are essential to disaster risk management? How are they produced and shared?</li>
            <li>Which Governments should improve and invest more in open data for better disaster risk management?</li>
            <li>Which disaster risk data are the more/less open? For which type of hazard?</li>
            <li>Which principles of Open Data for Resilience are the most difficult to implement?</li>
            <li>Which Governments perform better regarding disaster risk data and why? Is there any correlation with the level of hazards?</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text-center">
                <a href="#startReading"><span class="small"><span class="small text-muted"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> top</span></span></a>
            </div>
            <h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

            <p>The Open Data for Resilience Index has been developed with the following assumptions in mind:</p>

            <p>The role of a government is to curate or produce disaster risk datasets relevant to its territory or sub-territory. It should be accountable for the continued and effective use of the datasets through open publication of the data. The Open Data for Resilience Index therefore primarily focuses on assessing datasets per countries.</p>

            <p>There are countless datasets that may be used to perform DRM activities. However, only a few of them are critical, and if missing, may hinder or even prevent effective DRM. Those data are referred to as key risk datasets, and this project is about identifying, defining and assessing their openness across different places.</p>

            <p>Different datasets could match in part or completely with a specific key risk dataset description for a given territory. For instance you could have two different aerial imageries of your country provided by two different organizations. This is reflected in the Index where users can submit more than one dataset for a given key dataset description and a given country, each of them being assessed independently.</p>
