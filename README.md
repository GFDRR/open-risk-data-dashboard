The Open Data for Resilience Index assesses the state of open data for disaster risk management across the globe. It provides a list of key datasets that are needed for reducing vulnerability and building resilience to natural hazards, and that should be made available as open data for any country. Anyone can contribute to the index by submitting information on a dataset.

The Open Data for Resilience Index is managed by the <a href="https://opendri.org" target="_blank">Open Data for Resilience Initiative</a> (OpenDRI). Together with other tools and initiatives such as <a href="http://thinkhazard.org" target="_blank">ThinkHazard!</a>, <a href="http://geonode.org/" target="_blank">Geonode</a>, <a href="">Inasafe</a> and the <a href="https://understandrisk.org" target="_blank">Understanding Risk</a> community, it aims at improving risk information through better access to data.

## OpenDRI

In 2011, Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) launched the Open Data for Resilience Initiative to apply the concepts of the global open data movement to the challenges of reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. OpenDRI supports World Bank Regional Disaster Risk Management Teams to build capacity and long-term ownership of open data projects with client countries that are tailored to meet specific needs and goals of stakeholders.
