# Why do you use the index?

In order to submit India related datasets.


# What do you remember from your last visit of the index?

I remember the Index being a very transactional website, a website with a clear purpose.

I remember the objective statement to be clear.

I remember there are options to include datasets for your country.

I remember there are instructions and informations about the categories of datasets.


# What is your understanding of the OpenDRI Index?

The OpenDRI Index is a website that helps you upload datasets related to disaster risks in your country.


# Have you searched data on the Index?

Yes. That's how I understood the datasets were not stored on the website, but only their metadata.

❓ I wondered how the metadata were kept in sync with the sources?

Aside of that, I was not looking for country data, nor any specific dataset.

🗣 I was interested in discovering _how_ the data were organised.

🗣 I understand the OpenDRI Index collects the data, reflects their availability and tells us how is a government or country equiped to face disaster risks.

❓ What about if a source adds new datasets on their website, or if the dataset change (location, name, formats, its objectives, etc.) or if a dataset is removed? **Is it reflected on the OpenDRI Index?**<br>
⁉️ If so, there are high chances OpenDRI Index data to become inconsistent or outdated.

> I question the kind of effort in submitting datasets.

😒 It means additional work for me, to maintain the consistency and up to date informations.
This is something that I need to be clear about with my management, to have that time to maintain the datasets metadata.

😒 It is a _push_ effort, I need a motivation to do this work. What is this motivation to put the data on the Index?

😒 I need to convince the agencies to open their datasets, most of them are closed. What is my benefit to do so?

😶 There is no clear answer about that.

💡 **In an ideal way**, I see these two things:

1. there is a mechanism that **pulls changes** from the source website and the OpenDRI Index reflects those changes.
I imagine a routine that figures out sources has changed, with some form of system notification;
2. to compare countries, there must be a way to **compare contents** of datasets otherwise we are comparing apples and bananas.
Two same datasets from different countries can contain datapoints which make them uncomparable. They must share enough common ground to be useable.
