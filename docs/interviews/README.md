## Summary

### Key understanding of the Index

> OpenDRI Index compiles informations relative to the "preparedness" for disaster risk, and says if data are open data.

> It is a (…) site where you can find the sources of various datasets, for specific countries, and their kind of openness.

> The OpenDRI Index is a website that helps you upload datasets related to disaster risks in your country.

### What is valuable to them

- **Data** there is a good amount of datasets

- **UX** it is easy to navigate

### What is a burden to them

- **Score** the data is not understood and they don't get how it would help them.

- **Add a dataset** form is complex and does not capture their uncertainty about the data they

- **Add a dataset** choosing a category is hard and does not reflect how they would label a dataset (they would tick the relevant hazards directly)

- **Add a dataset** the field does not capture if the data are free to use or if an explicit license has other kind of implications (not for commercial use, etc.)

- **Data** a map available as PDF may be open, but it is unuseable, even if it ticks all the boxes of open data criteria

- **UX** some terms are not always clear (global data, worldwide or multi-region scale datasets?)

- **Dataset** category does not imply the many datasets will share a common ground in term of datapoints (column naming, data schema)

- **Add a dataset** is effortful and the more dataset you add, the more time-consumming the maintenance of the metadata becomes.

### What could be made to make the Index more valuable

- **Data** seeing water companies and university data as well

- **Data** be clearer on the required _fields_ for dataset categories — some datasets are not useable if they are missing

- **Data** getting to more qualitative (experience of contribution, experience of exploration, experience of data wrangling)

- **UX** label could convey their impact, what it is about, their usefulness and reading keys — instead of matching database field names (eg: "Dataset is open" vs. "Dataset can be downloaded publicly, without registration", etc.)

- **Metadata** can be refreshed from the sources themselves (via a feed or a data connector of some sort)

- **Metadata** could display in which real events the datasets have been used for (it increases the sense of usefulness)
