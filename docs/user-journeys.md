# User Journeys

## Initial Scope / Focus

1. staff from the World Bank (people working on risk disasters and management, urban development -- working on resilience issues)
	1. Colleagues of Small States Islands → to improve their capacity to respond, and they need data, and they would like to use the platform; what's laking (buildings data for example) → use the platform to track progress (monitoring platform)
	2. Colleagues of Balkans team → it's not even one project
	3. (They will populate the database and to bootstrap)
2. "Understanding Risk" community, informal, coordinated by colleagues within the World Bank
3. the Open Data community in general, because useful for other things (data elevation models and buildings for example) (people we don't know about)
	1. Academic researchers, that consume but not necessarily produce
4. Governments
	1. Showcasing how much open data they have

They might not know what you can capture about risk management. Get a sense of what is open data, what kind of data are behind "risk management".

## Journeys

- A person who arrives on the website to look for data
